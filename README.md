As part of the Odin Project curriculum i had to make a memory game. I decided on making the theme of it Tom Hanks movies.

In this project i applied the concepts that i've learned in the last React lessons such as: React Hooks, specifically useEffect(to make a fetch request to the API) and useState(to store the data i'm getting from the request).

Live version can be seen here <strong> https://altersandr.github.io/memory-game/ </strong>
